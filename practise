​🎮 GameBridge — Clear & Improved Explanation
​1️⃣ What GameBridge Is (Plain English)
​GameBridge is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that:
​Lets users discover and launch games from various studios in one place.
​Monetizes engagement for the platform owner when users:
​Watch featured ads before playing.
​Download full game versions from the Play Store.
​Progress through specific in-game levels.
​Gives you (Owner) full visibility into user actions and revenue generated per studio.
​Gives game studios a secure portal to track their game's performance and pay for the traffic you provide.
​2️⃣ User Flow (The Player Experience)
​🔐 Step 1: Login / Sign-Up: User enters via Google or Email. Firebase manages their profile and session.
​🕹️ Step 2: Discovery Dashboard: The user sees a curated list of games with two main options:
​▶️ Button 1: Play Now (with Ad): User watches a featured ad to unlock a web demo or instant play version. You earn ad revenue; the user gets immediate access to the game.
​📲 Button 2: Get Full App: Redirects the user to the Google Play Store. If they install it, you receive an "Install Attribution" event.
​3️⃣ Progress Tracking (For Billing)
​Even though players don't earn rewards, the system tracks their progress to trigger payments from the Studios to You:
​Milestones: When a player reaches a specific level (e.g., Level 10), an event is sent to Firebase.
​Verification: Cloud Functions verify the event is legitimate.
​Billing: This completion is logged as a "Billable Event," meaning the studio now owes you the pre-agreed fee for driving a high-quality player to that depth in their game.
​4️⃣ The Admin Portal (Your View)
​You monitor the entire ecosystem:
​👤 User Activity: Track active players and their engagement history.
​📺 Ad Analytics: See which games are generating the most ad views.
​📥 Performance Metrics: Total installs and level completions driven by your platform.
​💰 Balance Sheet: Real-time calculation of exactly how much each studio owes you based on the "Rate Card" you set.
​5️⃣ The Studio Portal
​Each studio gets a private dashboard to justify their costs:
​Transparency: They see the exact number of ads played and levels reached.
​Invoicing: They view and pay invoices for the traffic/players you sent them.
​Data Only: They cannot see your other partners or access your administrative settings.
​6️⃣ Why GameBridge Is Powerful
​✅ Platform Control: You decide the value of an install or a level completion.
​✅ B2B Revenue: Your income comes from professional studios paying for performance, not from managing player payouts.
​✅ Data Integrity: Every launch and level-up is a hard-coded event, making your billing impossible to dispute.
​✅ Zero Friction: Works as a PWA; players don't need to install GameBridge itself to start playing.
​7️⃣ In One Sentence (Pitch Ready)
​"GameBridge is a Firebase-powered PWA that monetizes game discovery by tracking ad views, installs, and level-based milestones—providing studios with a transparent, high-performance platform for user acquisition and billing
