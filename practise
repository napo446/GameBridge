🎮 GameBridge — Clear & Improved Explanation
1️⃣ What GameBridge Is (Plain English)

GameBridge is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that:

Lets users discover games

Rewards developers when users:

Watch ads before playing

Download games from Play Store

Reach specific in-game levels

Gives you (GameBridge owner) full visibility into:

User actions

Ad views

App installs

Level milestones

Payments owed & received

Gives game companies a secure portal to:

See performance

Pay you

Track compliance

Think of it as a bridge between users, advertisers, and game studios — hence GameBridge.

2️⃣ User Flow (Very Clear)
🔐 Step 1: Login / Sign-Up

User opens the PWA and sees a login page.

Login options:

Google Sign-In

Email & password

Firebase handles:

Authentication

Session management

User identity

🕹️ Step 2: Game Discovery Page

After login, the user sees a list of games.

Each game card shows:

Game name

Studio name

Rewards info

Two buttons:

▶️ Button 1: Play with Ad

User must watch 30+ second rewarded ad

After ad completion:

User can play the game (web demo / instant play / redirect)

You earn ad revenue

Event is tracked:

User ID

Game ID

Ad ID

Timestamp

📲 Button 2: Download App

Redirects to Google Play Store

Uses tracking link (campaign ID)

If app is installed:

You get install attribution

Potential CPI payout

Event is tracked:

Game ID

User ID

Install click

3️⃣ Level Tracking (Very Important)

Each game defines paid milestones, for example:

Game	Level	Payout
Zombie Rush	Level 5	$0.50
Zombie Rush	Level 10	$1.50
Racing Pro	Level 3	$0.30

How it works:

Game SDK or API sends level progress to GameBridge

Firebase Cloud Functions verify:

Valid user

Valid game

Valid level

When milestone is reached:

You are eligible for payment

Event is logged for billing

4️⃣ What You (Admin) Can See
🧠 Admin Portal (GameBridge Dashboard)

You can see:

👤 Users

Who signed up

Login method

Activity history

📺 Ads

Who watched which ad

For which game

Completion status

Revenue earned

📥 Downloads

Which apps were downloaded

From which campaign

Which users installed

🎯 Level Milestones

User progress per game

Which level triggered payment

Payment status

💰 Revenue Tracking

How much you’re owed

Per game

Per studio

Per period

5️⃣ Game Company Portal

Each game studio gets a restricted portal.

They can:

View their own game stats

See:

Ad plays

Installs

Level completions

See invoices

Pay securely

They cannot:

See other studios

Modify data

Access admin tools

6️⃣ Payments & Security
💳 Secure Payment Space

Firebase + Stripe (recommended)

Each payment linked to:

Game

Studio

Period

Payment statuses:

Pending

Paid

Overdue

Cloud Functions:

Validate payment

Lock records after payment

Generate receipts

7️⃣ Firebase Architecture (High Level)
🔥 Firebase Services Used
Service	Purpose
Firebase Auth	Login (Google + Email)
Firestore	Users, games, events
Cloud Functions	Secure logic (ads, payments)
Firebase Hosting	PWA hosting
Firebase Analytics	User behavior
Cloud Storage	Assets & reports
8️⃣ Data That Is Tracked (Very Important)

Every action becomes an event:

{
  "userId": "abc123",
  "gameId": "zombie_rush",
  "event": "ad_completed",
  "value": 0.05,
  "timestamp": "2025-12-22T10:15:00Z"
}


This makes:

Auditing possible

Payments provable

Disputes defensible

9️⃣ Why GameBridge Is Powerful

✅ You control attribution
✅ You control reporting
✅ You control payouts
✅ Studios trust your data
✅ Firebase scales automatically
✅ Works as PWA (no app install needed)

🔟 In One Sentence (Pitch Ready)

GameBridge is a Firebase-powered PWA that monetizes game discovery by tracking ad views, installs, and level-based milestones—giving developers and studios a transparent, secure platform for performance-based payouts.
